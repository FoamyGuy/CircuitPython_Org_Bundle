# CircuitPython Org Modules: Works In Progress

This is a list of links to CircuitPython modules from the organization
or community that are not ready to be submitted to the Bundle, but that
the author would like to inform others of the module's existence.

If you've written a CircuitPython driver that you'd like to make
available but don't feel it's ready for the CircuitPython Org Bundle, 
feel free to add a link to the GitHub repo below. 

If you'd like to see a driver listed below included in the 
CircuitPython Org Bundle, consider contacting the author to 
see how you can help get the driver ready for the Bundle.
